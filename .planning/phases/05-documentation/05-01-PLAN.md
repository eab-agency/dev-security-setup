# Phase 5 Plan 1: Documentation Overhaul

## Strategy

**Strategy A** — Fully autonomous, no checkpoints. Pure documentation changes to a single file (README.md). No external services, no destructive operations.

## Scope

Rewrite `README.md` to replace the obsolete clone-and-source installation model with Homebrew instructions, document all CLI flags, remove shell function references, and document the upgrade path. Consolidated from 2 roadmap plans since both edit the same file.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Rewrite README.md

**What**: Complete rewrite of README.md replacing clone-based instructions with Homebrew installation and updated usage documentation.

**Changes to `README.md`**:

1. **Header** — Keep project name and one-line description. Add a "What it does" bullet list (preserve existing).

2. **Installation section** — Replace entirely:
   - Remove: Clone repo, shell function, source ~/.zshrc
   - Add: `brew install eab-agency/tools/dev-security-setup`
   - Note: First time requires tap: `brew tap eab-agency/tools`
   - Prerequisites: Only Homebrew itself (deps are auto-installed)

3. **Usage section** — Update:
   - Remove: "The function auto-updates the repo before running"
   - Keep: `setup-security` as the command (same binary name)
   - Document all flags from `--help`: `--force/-f`, `--with-commitlint`, `--with-linting`, `--version/-v`, `--help/-h`
   - Show examples matching the script's own `--help` output

4. **Version tracking section** — Update:
   - Keep: `.security/version` tracking behavior (same/newer/force logic)
   - Update: "Newer version available" now shows `brew upgrade dev-security-setup` instead of git-pull
   - Add: Update check mechanism (cached GitHub API check, 24h interval)

5. **Upgrading section** — New:
   - `brew upgrade dev-security-setup`
   - Script auto-detects version change and re-configures on next run
   - Mention: automatic update alerts when running outdated version

6. **Files created table** — Keep existing, verify accuracy against current script

7. **Testing hooks section** — Keep existing manual test commands

8. **Uninstalling section** — New:
   - `brew uninstall dev-security-setup`
   - Note: per-project `.security/` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` are not removed (project-level files stay)

**Commit**: `docs: rewrite README for Homebrew distribution`

## Verification

- README renders correctly in markdown preview
- All code blocks use proper fencing
- No references to clone, shell function, source, or git pull remain
- Install command matches formula: `brew install eab-agency/tools/dev-security-setup`
- All flags from script's `--help` output are documented

## Estimates

- Tasks: 1
- Duration: ~2 min
- Risk: None (documentation only, single file)
